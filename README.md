Task5: use the RISCV core Verilog netlist and testbench for functional simulation experiment. Upload waveform snapshots for the commands on your github.
  : 1) It is having design code that is based on only 	RV32I base integer instruction R format and I format.
    2) it is also having testbench code to verify this design code.
